# park-periscope
A project to collect attribute information about parks within San Mateo County.

##Introduction
Parks are a wonderful resource, providing opportunities for recreation, access to nature, and community engagement. In San Mateo County, parks
are administered at the city/town, county, special district, state, and federal government levels, which can make finding information
about the locations of nearby parks and what ammenities they offer difficult. We would like to build an app and/or website
that allows users to search for parks near them and filter based on ammenities they may be interested in like basketball courts,
hiking trails, barbecue pits, dog-friendliness, etc. 

The county already has a spatial dataset of [279 parks, beaches, and open space locations available in the open data portal](https://data.smcgov.org/Environment/Parks-Beaches-and-Open-Spaces/mrrx-thc2).
Our goal is to search the web to collect information about what ammenities each location offers so that we can join this information to the 
spatial data and feed that combined product into an app or website viewer. 

##Data Collection
[Data are on the OpenSMC's Google Drive, available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-rAoxUBvlrf9MSeoKSR-ICclRfRSF2UHs0_TYcPDkls/edit#gid=0). 
You may need to ask permission from Michelle or John to get access to the spreadsheet.

1. To begin editing the spreadsheet, enter your initials into the **Author** column to claim a park to work on. This will make sure we're not
duplicating efforts. 
2. Enter the **name** of the park you claimed in step 1 into a search engine to find out more information about it and record that information
into the columns in the spreadsheet. 
3. If there is no information for a particular category, feel free to enter 'Unknown'.
4. Copy the address of the website you got the information from and enter that in the spreadsheet in the **URL of information source** column. 
5. Once you've completed collecting information about a park, enter 'Y' in the **Completed** column. 
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for a new park.
